The dashboard is being developed as part of WP1 of the OPENIT project, which aims to provide an overview of open access policies and initiatives within the scientific community. This tool will offer an interactive and detailed visualization of various open access policies and initiatives, such as PlanS, Horizon Europe, OPERAS, and DIAMAS, and help analyze the trends and impacts these policies have on scientific publishing. By using this dashboard, researchers and stakeholders will be able to track real-time developments in open access policies and assess their implementation across different contexts. This development responds to the growing need for transparency and understanding of the dynamics of open science within the scientific community.


2.1 Dashboard Creation
The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive community dashboard to visualize and analyze initiatives related to open scholarly communication. Developed using the R Shiny framework (Shiny - Posit), the dashboard provides an engaging platform where users can dynamically explore the dataset.
R Shiny was selected for its flexibility and interactivity, enabling users to filter and visualize data in real-time. The dashboard integrates information from ASAPbio’s prototype directory (Corker, K., & Shaw, L. C., 2024), categorizing initiatives based on key characteristics, such as focus area, governance structure, and geographic location. It includes interactive plots and a map to make it easier to investigate relationships between various initiatives.


Development Process Steps:
1. Data Integration:
 The ASAPbio dataset was enriched by adding geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), ISO 3 country codes, and thematic classifications. Six thematic categories were defined:

   * Community and Education

   * Data and Infrastructure

   * Journals and Publication Models

   * Open Science and Policies

   * Preprints and Repositories

   * Tools and Research Services



      2. Interactive Visualizations:

         * A map created with Leaflet displays initiatives geographically.

         * Charts developed using Plotly allow users to visualize distributions based on different governance models, categories, and geographic variables.

            3. User Contribution and Rights Management:
 The platform enables users to contribute by suggesting data modifications. Changes are reviewed and validated by trusted members (designated by the OSMI initiative: Open Science Monitoring) to ensure data accuracy.

            4. Long-term Hosting and Maintenance:
 The dashboard is hosted on an R Shiny server, with integration plans to expand its role in the OSMI initiative, ensuring ongoing dataset updates and community engagement.

            5. Code Availability:
 The code that powers the dashboard and its data processing is accessible on GitHub: View the Repository.

2.2 Classification and Categorization
To explore relationships between various initiatives, we employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC), which helped reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its categorical structure.
Key Techniques Used:
               * MCA: This statistical method examines the relationships between variables, such as governance models (e.g., community-driven or centralized), profit orientation (for-profit vs. non-profit), and thematic focus. It helps identify patterns and key dimensions that distinguish different initiatives.

               * HCPC: This method grouped initiatives into clusters based on shared attributes like governance, focus area, and geographic location. HCPC made it possible to visualize clusters and understand how initiatives with similar characteristics relate to each other.

2.3 Statistical Methods
By combining MCA and HCPC, the project effectively visualizes relationships between initiatives and simplifies the interpretation of complex data. MCA reduces the dataset’s complexity, revealing key patterns, while HCPC groups initiatives with shared operational strategies and governance.
Tools and R Packages Used:
                  * FactoMineR: For performing MCA

                  * Factoextra: For visualizing MCA and clustering results

                  * Plotly and Leaflet: For creating interactive plots and maps

This statistical framework allows users to explore the dynamics of open scholarly communication and better understand the relationships that drive various open science initiatives.
